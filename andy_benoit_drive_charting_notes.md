## Drive-Charting Guidelines

#### Motions:
There's a difference between shifts and motions. DO NOT label shifts, they're not considered part of the actual play. Motions take place when a single player changes his position in the formation before the ball is snapped. Shifts are when multiple players move to new positions before the rest of the offense needs to get set.

Simplified motion labeling: [Position] [in/out/bk/oRBit]. "TE in", "WR in", "RB out", "TE bk", "WR bk", etc.


#### Formations and WR splits:
Label formations left to right. So trips left, single WR right, single RB would be: 3x1, singleback

+ Closed = When there's a TE on the line but no WR's to that side, "closed L".
+ Dual TE LOS = when 2 TE's are lined up next to each other on the LOS. when there's 3 TE, call it "triple".
+ Bunch = when 3 receivers are grouped close togher, often in a triangular formation, usually in a minus split.
+ Stack = when 2 receivers are aligned one in front of the other.
+ Couple = when 2 receivers are close together, but are not stacked.
+ I-Form = two RB's, or a TE and a RB, aligned in a straight line behind the QB.
+ I-Form offset = when 2 RB's are behind the QB, but the fb is off-center, either right or left.
+ F-form = 3 RB's in backfield (fullhouse)
+ Shotgun offset L/R= QB in shotgun with a RB to one side, either right or left.
+ Shotgun 2 RB = QB in shotgun with a RB on each side.
+ Pistol = when QB is in a short shotgun with RB directly behind him
+ Pistol 2 RB = when QB is in short shotgun with a RB behind him and another RB to either side.
+ Pistol 3 RB = QB in short shotgun, RB behind him, and a RB on each side of the QB.
+ Unbl OL = when there's only 1 lineman to one side of the C.
+ Wildcat = When a WR is in the QB spot taking a direct snap while the QB is out wide.
+ 2 RB Wildcat = When there are 2 RB's in backfield taking a direct snap with QB out wide.

WR splits, their distance away from the ball in the formation, can be very subtle. There are 3 kinds:

+ Plus split = far away, denoted by a "+".
+ Minus split = closer in, denoted by a "-".
+ Even split = this one is less obvious and harder to see, denoted by a "\*".

Split symbols for the left side prefix the number of receivers. Split symbols for the right side suffix the number of receivers.
+ Example: "+2x2+"

So, 12 personnel with 2 TE's on the line on the left, with 2 WR's on the right, the farthest one outside the numbers, with the QB in shotgun and the RB to his right would be: "-2x2+", closed L, dual TE LOS, shotgun offset L".

+ The hash marks and the numbers on the field are the landmarks used to determine splits. This is where subtlety comes into play.
+ When the ball is between the hash marks, outside the numbers is "+", inside the numbers is "-", and on the numbers is "\*".


##### When the ball is on a hash mark:
+ Inside the near-side numbers to on the numbers is "-", on the outside edge of the numbers to within 1 yard outside the numbers is even, 2 yards or more outside the numbers is "+".
+ 2 yards inside the far-side numbers and in is "-", 1 yard inside the numbers to the edge of the numbers is even, on the numbers and out is "+".

##### Run Plays guidelines. These are not set in stone:
Explosive plays are highlighted in light blue (cyan):
+ On 3rd down = 12+ yards and gain a 1st down.
+ On 2nd down = 12+ yards and gains at least half of line to gain.

Runner is listed by last name, use first initial only if necessary.  
Lead Block is if a blocker lead blocks toward the play side. List by position, OL first then backfield. e.g. "LG, FB".

Run area is labeled by the design of the play, not the result. This means that execution and decision making by the RB can cause a different result than what was designed.

+ OR = outside right, beyond the farthest blocker, typically on tosses and sweeps. Look at the RB's shoulders as he takes the handoff, are they naturally facing the sideline?
+ IR = inside right, inside the farthest blocker, usually an OT or TE, but outside the outer shoulder of the RG.
+ M = between the outer shoulders of each G.
+ IL = inside left, inside the farthest blocker, usually an OT or TE, but outside the outer shoulder of the LG.
+ OL = outside left, beyond farthest blocker, typically on tosses and sweeps.

##### Pass plays:
Explosive plays are highlighted in yellow:
+ On 3rd down = 20+ yards and gains a 1st down.
+ On 2nd down = 20+ yards and gains at least half of line to gain.

Pass area is broken up into 9 categories:
+ LS = left sideline, outside the numbers
+ Swing L = typically a RB, running outside toward the numbers and behind the LOS.
+ WR Screen L = screen left, usually a receiver outside that takes an immediate pass on the LOS.
+ LM = left middle, between the numbers and left hash.
+ M = between the hash marks.
+ RM = between the righ hash and numbers.
+ Swing R = swing right, mirror definition of Swing L.
+ WR Screen R = screen right, mirrored definition of WR Screen L.
+ RS = right sideline, mirrored definition of LS.
+ Also: RB Screen L/R

Pass depth is how far the ball travels in the air, there are 4 categories:
+ Short = 9 yards or less.
+ Intermediate Short = 10-14 yards.
+ Intermediate Deep = 15-19 yards.
+ Deep = 20+ yards.
+ ...S, IS, ID, D

##### Target:
Is listed by last name, use first initial only if necessary.  
Where the receiver lined up at the snap will be put in "()", count outside to inside, so furthest receiver on right is "(R1)", etc.  
If the receiver is part of a bunch, label it "(BI), (BP-point man), (BO)".  
If the receiver is part of a stack, for example: front man in stack L-, label it: "(L- SF)".  
If back stack, label it: "(L- SB)".  
If receiver is part of a couple, label: "(L- CI)" and "(L- CO)", etc.  


Trips is when 3 receivers are out wide to one side, but aren't close enough to be a bunch, couple, or stack.  
For LOS TE's: label it "(L LOS TE, 3)", etc.  
For RB's: "(L RB, 2)", etc. If RB is directly behind QB, then "(RB 0)".  

Catch: Catch, Inc., PD (pass deflection), LOS PD [player last name], INT [player last name].


##### Play Action:
+ Hard = o-line run blocks and QB makes clear attempt to sell run.
+ Hard, roll = rollout.
+ Soft = QB makes a token gesture to RB, more for timing purposes. o-line pass sets at the snap.

Count Kneel downs as plays, but only label play description, gain, etc. Just the categories that are of absolute need.


##### Def Front:
The key is to look for the 3-tech. Only consider defenders that are listed on a team's official roster as DL, DE, DT, NT as potential 3-tech's. 3-4 OLB do not count.

There are 5 categories:
+ Over = a single 3-tech toward the strong side (TE).
+ Under = a single 3-tech toward the weak side (opposite TE).
+ Other Odd = when there's a NT or 1-tech. And there's no 3-tech.
+ Other Even = when there's no NT or 1-tech. And there's no 3-tech.
+ 2 Eagle Odd = when there are two 3-techs AND a NT.
+ 2 Eagle Even = when tere are two 3-techs WITHOUT a NT.
+ GL = Condensed D-Line and LB's with little to no DB's.
+ Double A Gap = when two LB or other defenders are standing over the A gaps.


##### Strength of Formation:
1. LOS TE determines which side is strong.
2. If no LOS TE, then use passing strength (number of receivers out wide).
3. RB location. The side with the RB is the strong side.
4. Field location/hash marks. Whichever side has the most field is the strength.
5. If formation and field are completely balanced, then go by whichever front the defense uses most.


##### Pass Rushers:
Be sure to discern when a player is merely marking a RB/TE who's staying in to block. They sometimes look like pass rushers, but they're not.

+ Sacks = List by last name in Catch column.
